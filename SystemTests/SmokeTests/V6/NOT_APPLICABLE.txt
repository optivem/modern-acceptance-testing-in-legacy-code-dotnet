V6 (BaseScenarioDslTest with Gherkin-style Given-When-Then DSL) is not applicable for simple smoke tests.

Smoke tests are basic connectivity checks that verify the system is accessible.
They don't require the full Given-When-Then scenario structure.

V6 is intended for complex E2E tests with business scenarios, not smoke tests.

For smoke tests, use:
- V5 (BaseSystemDslTest) - fluent SystemDsl API
